//......for each loop....... for each loopis not considered as technically loop but actually as a method on the array. works exactly like a loop //  



const mystates = ["tamil nadu", "delhi", "assam", 1994, "rajesthan", "maharashtra"];


mystates.forEach((s) => console.log(s));  // advantage of this for each loop is if ihad loop through the values i had to use my states and squar brackets and mark, indexes this is some time makes headach there is lot that you can avoid by using the foreach. foreach takes call backfunction //

//foreach goes through automatically with each element you dont have to say is mystate squar bracket i you dont say that im gonna simply say s for state and next simply say console.log(s) thats it simple
